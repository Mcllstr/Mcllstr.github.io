Visualizing (almost) every USA flight route

This is an interactive network map of nearly every unique domestic flight route in the USA.  The red lines represent routes, the blue circles are airports, and their size represents the number of unique flight routes operating at each airport (bigger circle = more flight connections).

I created this in python using using data from the Department of Transportation and openflights.org. 

This site is under construction so bear with us!
